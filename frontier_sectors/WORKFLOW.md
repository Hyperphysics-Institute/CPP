## Workflow / Infrastructure (WORKFLOW) — 1 problem

### OPEN-WORKFLOW-1: Consolidate All Bibliography Files
**Status:** OPEN
**Sector(s):** Infrastructure
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**One-line statement:** Merge all 12 per-paper and per-series `.bib` files into `bibliography/cpp_references.bib` as the single master bibliography; update old paper `.tex` files to reference it.
**What a solution looks like:** (1) Audit all 245 existing entries across 12 files; (2) resolve 22 known citation-key collisions (different content with same key); (3) merge 113 unique entries into master; (4) update `\bibliography{}` commands in all existing paper `.tex` files to reference master only; (5) move legacy `.bib` files to `archive/pre_consolidation_2026-04-15/`; (6) verify all papers still compile with same citation output.
**Tractability:** 1 dedicated session (2–3 hours of focused collision resolution and compile verification)
**What was done (15 April 2026):** Policy declared — master file is single source of truth; new papers cite master only; legacy files frozen with deprecation headers. SS-3 bibliography entries (cpp_ss3, humphreys1972) added to master. Stale `cpp_ss3` key in strong-series bibs renamed to `cpp_ss3_old_gluons` to free the namespace.
**Paper(s):** None (infrastructure)
**Last updated:** 15 April 2026
