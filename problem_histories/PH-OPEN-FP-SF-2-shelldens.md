## The Problem

Derive from CPP primitives the s_H shell-density factor entering the Higgs cage mass formula, currently calibrated to the observed Higgs mass.

### Mechanism context (SF-2 v1.0)

The H dodecahedron mass formula in SF-2 §7 incorporates a shell-density factor $s_H$ that captures the per-vertex SSV-cooperative contribution to the H cage binding. At v1.0, $s_H$ is calibrated to reproduce the observed Higgs mass ~125 GeV. The factor is structurally analogous to the cage-stability dilution factor $\eta_H$ (OPEN-FP-SF-2-η) but specific to the dodecahedral geometry where the 20-vertex second-shell structure introduces a shell-density distinction from the 12-vertex Z icosahedron.

### Closure route

Substrate-derivation requires the shell-density factor to emerge from the dodecahedral $A_5$ rotation group structure plus the SSV-cooperative reinforcement framework (inherited from SM-8/9). Specifically, the per-vertex contribution to total cage binding is structurally distinct from the 12-vertex icosahedral case because the dodecahedral graph has different connectivity (each vertex has degree 3 vs icosahedral degree 5) and different orbit structure under $A_5$. The shell-density factor captures this geometric distinction. Closure path: combine the H cage geometry with substrate thermodynamics (likely shared with OPEN-FP-SF-2-η and OPEN-FP-SF-2-EWSB).

### Open remarks

The Higgs scalar character is theorem-level at finite-group rigor (THEO-SF-2-3 + Cor higgs_scalar gives $A_5 \to J=0$); the relativistic Lorentz-scalar character inherits via the continuum-limit Yang-Mills EFT (THEO-SF-2-5 proof outline). The shell-density factor closure is the remaining sub-task to upgrade the Higgs mass prediction from calibrated to zero-parameter.

## The Journey

### Pre-SF-2 (Sessions 1-80)

The problem was implicit in the CPP electroweak sector but not formally registered. SM-1 four-cage taxonomy + SS-1 binary icosahedral group structure provided foundational inheritances. EW-1 through EW-5 papers (predecessors to SF-2) had partial structural sketches but no theorem-level closure framework.

### Session 41 architectural revision (9 May 2026)

Patch 0301 revised SF-line architecture from 5-paper Option-3 to 7-paper architecture (SF-1 through SF-7); SF-2 scoped to electroweak cage bosons (W±/W⁰/Z/H) with W⁰ novel-particle prediction registered as CONJ-EW-W0. The six OPEN-FP-SF-2-* problems were not yet split out at this point — they were implicit in the "SF-2 substrate-level closure" goal.

### Sessions 81-82 SF-2 v0.x drafting (Patches 0345-0361)

Eleven patches building SF-2 main paper from v0.1 outline through v0.7 with three multi-reviewer convergence cycles. Mass formula architecture with three calibrated dilution factors ($\eta_W$, $\eta_Z$, $\eta_H$ — OPEN-FP-SF-2-η implicit) plus EWSB cage-formation framing in §11 (OPEN-FP-SF-2-EWSB implicit) plus structural-level discussions of one-loop oblique corrections, shell-density factor, DP-chain composition, and V-A chirality.

### Session 83 Companion paper + multi-reviewer cycles (Patches 0362-0367)

Six patches developing Companion paper from v1.0 kickoff through v1.4 with actual GPU-result incorporation (DP-chain composition exploratory toy MC reports (40.3% / 29.7% / 29.6% / 0.4%) at Patch 0364; oblique-parameter $\Delta T \approx 0$ structural prediction confirmation at Patch 0366; sensitivity-scan with-bounds-region geometric structure at Patch 0366; ChatGPT v1.3 final polish at Patch 0367). The six OPEN-FP-SF-2-* problems became explicitly tracked at this point as the rigor-frontier work remaining post-v1.0.

### Patch 0368 (14 May 2026) — v1.0 SHIP with OPEN-FP-SF-2-* registered

Joint main paper + Companion v1.0 SHIP at Patch 0368 (Session 83 close) with three-reviewer convergence on SHIP-at-v1.0 verdict. The six OPEN-FP-SF-2-* problems formally registered as the substrate-level closure frontier:
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-η: cage-stability dilution factor first-principles derivation
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-EWSB: EWSB cage-formation mechanism first-principles derivation
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-loopfactor: one-loop oblique correction structure first-principles derivation
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-shelldens: shell-density factor first-principles derivation
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-chaincomp: substrate-thermodynamic DP-chain composition derivation
- OPEN-FP-SF-2-CHIR: chirality emergence in W bracelet (V-A coupling derivation)

## Dependencies

**Inherits from:**
- SF-2 v1.0 framework (THEO-SF-2-1 through THEO-SF-2-5; PROP-SF-2-1 through PROP-SF-2-6)
- SM-6 Weinberg-angle spectral-trace correspondence (numerical inheritance, no derivation dependence)
- SM-7/8/9 cage-stability mass-formula machinery (parameter-architecture inheritance)
- SS-1 binary icosahedral group $\Gamma$ structure (gauge-algebra inheritance via THEO-SF-2-5)
- 600-cell topology and orbit-stabilizer structure (geometric foundational inputs)

**Likely shared closure path with:**
`OPEN-FP-SF-2-eta`, `OPEN-FP-SF-2-EWSB`, `OPEN-FP-SF-2-loopfactor`, `OPEN-FP-SF-2-chaincomp`, `OPEN-FP-SF-2-CHIR`

The six OPEN-FP-SF-2-* problems are not fully independent — they share dependencies on substrate thermodynamics (OPEN-FP-SF-2-EWSB, OPEN-FP-SF-2-η, OPEN-FP-SF-2-shelldens, OPEN-FP-SF-2-chaincomp) and continuum-EFT structure (OPEN-FP-SF-2-loopfactor, OPEN-FP-SF-2-CHIR). Closure of these substrate-level frameworks at Layer 4 (per PD-004) may resolve multiple OPEN-FP-SF-2-* entries simultaneously.

## Falsification route

The closure of OPEN-FP-SF-2-shelldens from CPP primitives plus the appropriate foundational inputs would be falsified by:
1. Foundational input errors (incorrect inheritance from SF-2 v1.0 framework or upstream papers)
2. Sub-claim proof errors (should be checked by external review during Layer 4 dedicated paper review cycle)
3. Experimental disagreement with the resulting prediction (e.g., precision-electroweak measurement contradicting derived $\Delta S, T, U$ structure for OPEN-FP-SF-2-loopfactor)

---

## Cross-sector connections

OPEN-FP-SF-2-CHIR potentially cross-sector-closeable with OPEN-SM-4 (Capotauro mechanism for $\delta_{CP}$) per the methodological pattern of SF-4 v4.0's first cross-sector closure (Finding β-10): single derivation chain simultaneously resolves open problems in two distinct papers when the foundational inputs of one closure are sufficiently rich to determine the closure in another sector. The Capotauro dedicated paper (Session 82 priority for SF-4 8/8 completion) is the candidate closure venue.
